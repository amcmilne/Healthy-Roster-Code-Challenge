# Healthy-Roster-Code-Challenge

## In this code challenge, I have built an application that uses the Healthy Roster API to fetch data from two endpoints.  It will first fetch and displays a list of organizations for the healthcare provider. Clicking on the organization then displays a list of the teams which exist under that organization.
